    Easily start and stop formulae via launchctl.

    Integrates Homebrew formulae with macOS' launchctl manager. Services can be
    added to either /Library/LaunchDaemons or ~/Library/LaunchAgents.
    Basically, items in /Library/LaunchDaemons are started at boot, while those
    in ~/Library/LaunchAgents are started at login.

    When started with sudo, it operates on /Library/LaunchDaemons; otherwise,
    it operates on ~/Library/LaunchAgents.

    On start the plist file is generated and written to a Tempfile, and then
    copied to the launch path (existing plists are overwritten).

    [sudo] bservice list
    List all running services for the current user (or root)

    [sudo] bservice formula|--all run
    Run the service formula without starting at login (or boot).

    [sudo] bservice formula|--all start
    Start the service formula immediately and register it to launch at login (or boot).

    [sudo] bservice formula|--all stop
    Stop the service formula immediately and unregister it from launching at login (or boot).

    [sudo] bservice formula|--all restart
    Stop (if necessary) and start the service immediately and register it to launch at login (or boot)."
